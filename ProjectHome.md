The purpose of the utility is to provide users with a tool which can retrieve information from the web based on their personal preferences, browsing history and search pattern. To ascertain the user's browsing pattern the utility monitors the user's browsing activity over a period of time. When the user is on the move and needs some information, the user needs to send a SMS or E-Mail from his mobile device to the utility. The utility checks for new mails or messages on a regular basis and based on the content of the message received, the utility checks the user's browsing history to find what he had earlier browsed that matches the information he currently needs. It then extracts information from sites for which the wrappers are present and then compares the results from various sites. The utility then provides the best available information to the user by calling the user and reading the information over the phone. In addition the system also sends the result as an E-Mail to the user.
